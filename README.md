Using openWeatherMap's API, I created this single page app to show current weather information in 4 different cities. 

The site is live here! : http://development.open-weather-api.divshot.io

This project was built with [OpenWeatherMaps's API](http://openweathermap.org/api), JavaScript to parse the data, jQuery to manipulate the DOM, and of course HTML, CSS, and also Bootstrap :)
